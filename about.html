                I specialize in full-stack web development, working extensively with technologies like MongoDB, Node.js, and Mongoose for robust backends, and modern front-end frameworks to bring dynamic web applications to life. With hands-on experience in development workflows, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and building scalable solutions.

                I'm passionate about learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web. I thrive when solving challenging problems and turning complex ideas into intuitive digital products. Beyond development, I'm an avid gamer, and I love diving into new virtual worlds. Gaming helps fuel my creativity and motivates me to continue building immersive experiences, whether on the web or in a game.
